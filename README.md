# Permutation and Combination Calculator

This is a calculator for both the combination formula and permutation formula back in junior high.

## What are Permutations and Combinations?

- **Permutations**: The arrangement of objects in a specific order. The order matters in permutations.
- **Combinations**: The selection of objects without regard to the order. The order does not matter in combinations.

## Project Structure

- **PermuAndCombi_Calculator.py**: The main script for calculating permutations and combinations.

## Getting Started

To use the calculator, clone the repository and run the `PermuAndCombi_Calculator.py` script using Python.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Noulion/Permutation-and-Combination-Calculator.git
cd Permutation-and-Combination-Calculator
python PermuAndCombi_Calculator.py
```
